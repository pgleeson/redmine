<h2>Status</h2>



<p><b>Note: this table is still in development!!.</b></p>
<p>These status values are currently based on a manual curation process, scoring the models on the completeness of the translation of the model from the original format to NeuroML (or PyNN). </p>
<p>For simulators, the score represents how well the model translates to the specific simulator from the simulator independent format, not availability of original scripts in that simulator. </p>
<p>The longer term aim is to have these scores generated automatically from tests based on parsing of the NeuroML and comparison to expected model behaviour. </p>
